# Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Transformer for Video-based Person Re-Identification

## Abstract

Temporal cues are crucial to the video-based person re-identification (ReID). However, it remains a challenging task to model the temporal cues so as to extract representative and discriminative video-level features for the person ReID. To address this problem, a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Transformer (STAFormer) is proposed for the video-based person ReID in this paper. The proposed STAFormer is mainly composed of spatial and temporal aggregation modules, which allows for a unified framework for effective frame-level feature extraction as well as temporal cues aggregation with an attention mechanism. Specifically, the spatial aggregation module first extracts the frame-level features by adaptively fusing the local and global features
with an attention mechanism. Similarly, the temporal aggregation module also leverages the attention mechanism to aggregate these frame-level features into the video-level representations. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed STAFormer is effective for video-based person ReID with the ability to jointly frame-level feature extraction and temporal cues aggregation.

## Requirements
You can install all required Python packages via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
All experiments in this project are conducted on the MARS dataset, which remains the largest benchmark for video-based person re-identification to date. Please follow [Video-Person-ReID](https://github.com/jiyanggao/Video-Person-ReID) to prepare the data. The instructions are copied here:
1. Create a directory named ```mars/``` under ```data/```.
2. Download the MARS dataset from the following link and place it into the ```data/mars/``` directory: [http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/Project/project_mars.html](http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/Project/project_mars.html).
3. Extract ```bbox_train.zip``` and ```bbox_test.zip``` into ```data/mars/```.
4. Download split information from [https://github.com/liangzheng06/MARS-evaluation/tree/master/info](https://github.com/liangzheng06/MARS-evaluation/tree/master/info) and put ```info\``` in ```data/mars```. After completing the above steps, the directory structure should look like this:
```
mars/
     bbox_test/
     bbox_train/
     info/
```
5. Use the parameter ```--dataset mars``` when training..

## Get started
To train the model, please run
```
python main.py \
   --arch make_model\
   --dataset ${mars, lsvid, ...} \
   --root ${path of dataset} \
   --gpu_devices 0,1 \
   --save_dir ${path for saving modles and logs}
```
Replace ```${path of dataset}``` and ```${path for saving modles and logs}``` with your actual paths.

To test the model, please run
```
#Test with all frames
  python main.py \
   --arch make_model \
   --dataset mars \
   --root ${path of dataset} \
   --gpu_devices 0,1 \
   --save_dir ${path for saving logs} \
   --evaluate --all_frames --resume ${path of pretrained model}
```
## Result

| Dataset | MARS | LS-VID |     
| ------- | ---- | ------ |
| mAP     | 89.1 | 85.6   |
| Rank-1  | 91.5 | 90.9   |
